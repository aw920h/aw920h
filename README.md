## Project History

My journey began in 2019 exploring AI and tech, starting with pyaudio and gTTS for building voice bots. I dove deep into various tech domains, working with PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and eventually CI/CD pipelines by 2023. 

Since 2024, I've shifted focus to where technology meets real-world impact—**sustainability in civil and environmental engineering**. Combining my tech background with industry-grade tools like PLAXIS, GeoStudio, WaterGEMS, AutoCAD, STAAD.Pro, ANSYS, and HyperView, I'm working on solutions that matter for our planet's future.
